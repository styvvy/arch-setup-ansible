All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

LanguageTool detects many errors that a simple spell checker cannot, such as grammar issues, commonly confused words, and punctuation oversights. Additionally, LanguageTool offers style suggestions to elevate your writing: synonym replacements for overused words, concise rephrasing of wordy sentences, and formal alternatives to commonly used expressions.\n\nLanguageTool is designed with simplicity in mind, instantly analyzing your text as you type. It is compatible with most platforms, including social networks such as Twitter and LinkedIn, and e-mail services such as Gmail.\n\nWith LanguageTool, our aim is to give users a full-feature grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it also recognizes many mistakes that are frequently made by native speakers. This grammar and spelling correction works across several varieties of commonly spoken languages, and is capable of distinguishing between American and British English. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use, but are not found in a conventional dictionary; it will learn to recognize these words for future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike other services like Grammarly (a.k.a. Grammerly :-), QuillBot, and Ginger, LanguageTool supports more than 25 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Polish, and Russian (see below for the complete list).\n\nYour privacy is important to us: By default, this extension will check your text by sending it to languagetool.org over a securely encrypted connection. No account is needed to use this extension. We don't store your IP address.
